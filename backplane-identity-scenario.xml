      <t>While Backplane is a generic framework for message exchange
        between trusted applications in the context of a browser session,
        the Identity Scenario is a specific protocol that facilitates
        authentication and identity transactions between those
        applications.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
          NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
          "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
          in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="identity.representation" title="Representation Of Identity Information"><!-- [[[ -->
      <t>User identity information communicated between Backplane
        parties in this scenario is represented in
        <xref target="PortableContacts">Portable Contacts</xref> (PoCo)
        format with some restrictions and extensions.</t>

      <t>PoCo data is presented in the <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref>
        format.</t>

      <t>Since the scenario deals with a single user (the one
        performing identity-related actions in the context of a concrete
        browsing session), PoCo response node MUST contain a single
        "entry" object.</t>

      <t>The "entry" object MUST contain the "accounts" element with at
        least one item. Each of the account items represents an
        identity.</t>

      <t>An identity is represented by "identityUrl" element, which can
        be either a plain <xref target="RFC1738">URL</xref> of user identity,
        or normalized SGN identity <xref target="RFC3986">URI</xref>
        constructed from domain/userid pair by putting these values
        together: <spanx style="verb">sgn://&lt;DOMAIN&gt;/?ident=&lt;USERID&gt;</spanx>.
        In the latter case SGN identity URI MUST be recognized by
        <xref target="Google.SGNodeMapper">Google's SGNodeMapper</xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="message.types" title="Message Types"><!-- [[[ -->
      <t>Below is a list of Backplane message types employed in this
        scenario.</t>

      <section anchor="message.type.identity.login" title="identity/login">
        <t>This message is transmitted whenever an application (e.g. an
          Identity Manager) on a Backplane channel authenticates a user
          against an identity provider (e.g. Twitter or Facebook). The
          only party that is allowed to post this message is the one
          that directly facilitated the authentication (login) process
          (e.g. an Identity Connector).</t>

        <t>The payload of the 'identity/login' message is a JSON object
          which contains the following fields:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="context">the URL of the page where the authentication took
              place</t>
            <t hangText="identities">a PoCo object listing the identities that the user
              has gained by authenticating</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="message.type.identity.logout" title="identity/logout">
        <t>This message is transmitted whenever an application (e.g. an
          Identity Manager) on a Backplane channel logs the user out of
          an identity provider (e.g. Twitter or Facebook). The only
          party that is allowed to post this message is the one that
          directly facilitated the logout process (e.g. an Identity
          Connector).</t>

        <t>The payload of the 'identity/logout' message is a JSON object
          which contains the following fields:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="context">the URL of the page where the logout took place</t>
            <t hangText="identities">a PoCo object listing the identities that the user
              has dropped with the logout</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="message.type.session.ready" title="session/ready">
        <t>This message is transmitted whenever Echo platform
          successfully creates a session for the user (and optionally
          creates a user record if one did not exist before) using the
          payload information from the identity/login message mentioned
          above or when an users logs out.</t>

        <t>The payload of the "session/ready" message is a JSON object which
          contains the following field:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="session">a JSON object with user identity
              information stored in the session</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>A session stores information about a user's account in a
            format similar to the one mentioned above (transmitted in the
            identity/login messages), however it also has Echo platform specific
            information. Here is an example of such a record:</preamble>
          <artwork type="example">
{
    "poco": {
        "startIndex": 0,
        "itemsPerPage": 1,

            "id": "0d2a33a98fb227778f8f200aebf7f64d",
            "accounts": [
                {

                    "identityUrl": "http://google.com/profiles/johndoe",
                    "username": "John"
                },
                {
                    "loggedIn": "true",
                    "identityUrl": "http://twitter.com/johndoe",
                    "emails": [
                       {
                          "value": "johndoe@email.com",
                          "primary": "true"

      "markers" : ["m1", "m2", "m3"],
      "state" : "ModeratorBanned"
    }
}
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>As you can see, the record has data in PoCo format in a
          separate field with name "poco", and Echo platform specific
          information is transmitted in the field "echo".  The "echo"
          field stores information about state of the user in the Echo
          platform â€“ the user's roles, markers, and an identity
          specific information in the "accounts" field.  For example,
          the field "loggedIn" stores information about whether an user
          successfully logged with the specified identity or not.  The
          "identityUrl" field stores normalized identity URL (recovered
          from SGN form to a profile URL or a plain URL for the OpenID
          identities).</t>

    <section anchor="use.cases" title="Use Cases"><!-- [[[ -->
      <t>The following use cases illustrate the process highlighting
        implementation details of the Echo service, but it is important
        to note that Echo is not in any way a 'special' party. Any other
        similar service can employ the Backplane Identity Scenario
        without a need to inform or modify other parties.</t>

      <section anchor="use.cases.parts" title="Interacting Parties"><!-- [[[ -->
        <t>The use cases mentioned below make use of the following interacting parties:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>A customer, serving content off http://customer.com.</t>
            <t>An independent Backplane server (running CNAMEd to
              backplane.customer.com), serving the customer's bus.</t>
            <t>
              Widgets on the customer's page:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Echo Stream Client (ESC)</t>
                <t>Identity Manager (IM)</t>
                <t>Login Status Widget (LSW)</t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>Identity Connector idcon.com, acting as a server-side
              counterpart of the IM.</t>
            <t>Echo server components:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>an API endpoint for Echo widgets on the customer's
                  page (available behind echoapi.customer.com
                  CNAME).</t>
                <t>an API endpoint for server-to-server communication
                  (available as api.aboutecho.com).</t>
                <t>a bus consumer - a server component listening to all
                  messages broadcast on the customer's bus.</t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              <xref target="use.cases.parts.submission.proxy">Echo Submission Proxy</xref>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>All the parties are configured to use the same Backplane bus
          "customer.com". The configuration includes merely stating the
          Backplane server address and bus identifier for widgets
          (operating in read-only mode). Parties that post data (e.g.
          the Identity Connector) or listen to the entire Backplane bus
          (e.g. the Echo bus consumer) also need to have
          a username/password set up with the Backplane server to
          perform secure HTTPS  requests with basic HTTP
          authentication.</t>

        <section anchor="use.cases.parts.identity.manager" title="Identity Manager"><!-- [[[ -->
          <t>Identity Manager (IM) is an Echo-specific widget that
            allows user to manage their identity. IM is not required to
            be a part of the workflow and is described here just to aid
            in understanding of the use cases.</t>

          <t>
            Once the page loads, Identity Manager fetches a list of
            supported identity providers (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,
            Customer's Own Login System) from its per-domain
            configuration. Each item of the list contains:

            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Identity Provider's favicon.</t>
              <t>Identity Provider's name ("Twitter", "Facebook").</t>
              <t>A URL of an Identity Connector that facilitates
                logins/logouts for the Identity Provider in this context
                (e.g. for this customer).</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>This way a customer may mix and match which Identity Connectors are used
            to deal with specific Identity Providers.</t>

          <t>Identity Manager presents the Identity Provider list to the user for selection. Once the user chooses to authenticate against a certain provider, the Identity Manager opens the Identity Connector's URL in a popup passing it the Backplane channel id as a parameter.</t>

          <t>This procedure is not detailed below in the use cases for the sake of brevity; it is referred to only as "the user initiates a login using IM".</t>
        </section><!-- ]]] -->

        <section anchor="use.cases.parts.submission.proxy" title="Echo Submission Proxy"><!-- [[[ -->
          <t>Echo servers don't accept insecure data submissions: all
            such requests have to be securely signed and originate from
            a server side. This prevents a widget from submitting data
            directly to Echo APIs (otherwise a secret would be
            exposed).</t>

          <t>In order to circumvent such limitation Echo widgets use
            server counterparts which:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>receive data from the widgets via an ad-hoc protocol;</t>
              <t>perform authorization checks to make sure that the
                current user is indeed allowed to submit the data;</t>
              <t>place the data on the Echo server in a secure
                manner.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>These components are called "submission proxies" since they
            pass through data submission requests.</t>

          <t>Echo Submission Proxy (ESP) is the submission proxy for
            Echo Stream Client.</t>

        <t>Backplane Identity Scenario is a stateless protocol. There is
          no way to retrieve the current state from Backplane. In order

          events occuring on a channel. Another possibility is to use an
          API of a service which does that (for example, if a widget is
          certain that Echo is on the Backplane channel, the former can
          get user account information from the Echo server
          directly).</t>

          executed on the page where login happens. This will ensure
