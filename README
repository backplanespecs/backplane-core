Backplane related specifications. 

== Before you begin... ==

Please make sure to update dates in the XML source (search for '<date') when
making substantial (i.e. non-cosmetic) changes to the specs.

== How to compile up to date versions of TXT, HTML, PDF ==

To compile HTML, TXT and PDF variants of the specifications
one needs to install software packages mentioned below and run
make.

Example:

% make clean && make

== Dependencies ==

TXT, HTML and PDF builds require presence of
tclsh8.4 (http://www.tcl.tk/).
If you would like to use another version of TCL
you should change path to tclsh in the accompanying Makefile.
Please note that on a Mac tclsh8.4 is installed by default,
so you do not need to perform any special actions.

PDF build requires presence of:
- apache fop (version 0.95 or later) - http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
- xsltproc from libxslt - http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/.
On a Mac installation of the packages can be accomplished with help of
the following commands:

% sudo port install fop
% sudo port install libxslt
