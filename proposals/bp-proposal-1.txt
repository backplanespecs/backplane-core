Title: Backplane Versioning Model

MOTIVATION
==========

Since we have a goal of making Backplane a widely adopted open protocol
used by multiple independent vendors, we need to provide clients with a
clear understanding of changes that may occur from one release of the
Backplane specification to the next.

PROPOSAL
========

Proposed is a pretty standard versioning model (see [1]) with major, minor
and patch version numbers. The following rules apply:

 • Client and server of different major version numbers are not
 interoperable.

 • Changes introduced in minor releases of the specification (such
 releases result in a minor version number bump) are always
 backwards-compatible. This means that if a client depends on features
 found in Backplane version X.Y, it will work with Backplane version X.Z
 provided that Z >= Y.

 • Minor releases can introduce new features and mark existing features as
 deprecated to discourage their further use by clients. Data formats can be
 extended in backwards-compatible manner (older clients should still be able
 to consume such data items).

 • Patch versions of the specification can only introduce nonsubstantial
 changes (typo fixes, wording changes etc). It is recommended that clients
 specify dependencies only on major and minor version numbers. If a client
 was built with Backplane version X.Y.Z as a dependency, it will work
 with any patch version of Backplane X.Y anyways.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

Action items to implement the proposal:

 • Display the versioning strategy and details on the project web site
 (TBD where exactly).
