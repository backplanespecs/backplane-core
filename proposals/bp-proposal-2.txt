Title: Backplane Version Discovery

MOTIVATION
==========

Clients need to know capabilities of the environment they run in to check
dependencies and ensure interoperability. Versioning model[1] outlines
general principles and this proposal deals with technical aspects of version
discovery.

PROPOSAL
========

Backplane defines an HTTP and Javascript APIs both of which have to provide
means for version discovery.

1. HTTP API
-----------

A Backplane server should support the following method for clients to
discover the version of the specification it is compliant with:

GET /version (HTTP/HTTPS)

Parameters:
 • callback (optional, string) — callback function to pad the response with.
 MUST only contain alphanumeric characters (a-zA-Z0-9).

Returns:
 • Content-type: application/json (if the 'callback' parameter was omitted) or
 application/javascript (if the 'callback' parameter was present).
 • Body: a possibly padded JSON object of the following structure:
   • version
     • major (integer) — major version number.
     • minor (integer) — minor version number.
     • patch (integer) — patch version number.

Response example:
{
  "version":
  {
    "major": 2,
    "minor": 1,
    "patch": 3
  }
}

2. Javascript API
-----------------

The Javascript library MUST check the server version upon initialization
and retain the object returned. If the server is of an incompatible
Backplane version, diagnostics should be provided (TBD how exactly) and all
subsequent calls to the Backplane library should return errors (TBD: should
we rather undefine 'Backplane'?).

New function Backplane.version() should return a copy of the version object
received from the server.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

Action items to implement the proposal:

 • Modify the specification to include the new APIs.

 • Implement version checking in the Javascript library.

 • Implement Backplane.version() function.
